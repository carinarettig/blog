# Stay safe. Stay at home.

During these days we all are told to stay at home.
So we face new issues to get our work done. I mostly do workshops which took place onside. I tried to sell remote workshops since september 2019 but no one was interested in.

Now, we have to do almost everysthing remote, we have to make sure, remoteworkshops work fine.

Here I want to show you my hardware and software I use.

# My remote setup

First of all, this is my setup, most of it I bought it more than one year ago to do my AMA sessions and Videocall while draveling, so everything had to be plug and play.

## My computer and Monitor

I use a [Surface Book 2](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/surface-book-2/8mcpzjjcc98c) for my all day work and I love it. It has two USB 3.0 ports. In my homeoffice I plug it in to a [Surface Dock](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/surface-dock/8qrh2npz0s0p) to use a second monitor (Benq GL2450) which is mountetd on the wall with a mounting arm found on ebay.

## Keyboard and Mouse

I love slim keyboards.
So I use a [CHERRY KC 6000 SLIM](https://www.cherry.de/cherry-kc-6000-slim.html).
I'm not that picky when it come to a mouse. I use a [CHERRY MW 2310](https://www.cherry.de/cherry-mw-2310.html).

## Camera

I started my AMA session back in 2018 by using the front camera of my Surface Book, but then I wanted to be more flexibe when I place the camera, so I was looking for a Webcam. I picked a [Logitech C922 pro stream](https://www.logitech.com/de-de/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam) and I love it. You can clamp it on your monitor or you can use this little tripod they ship with the cam. I clamped it on top of my monitor, so it is decoupled from my desk and from all the vibrations I produce while typing.

## Microphone

To find a good mic was a bit harder. My requirements: It must be a USB mic because I want to use it in the hotel room and at home. My first mic I bought was a [Maranz Pod Pack 1](https://www.amazon.de/Marantz-Professional-Pod-Pack-USB-Kondensatormikrofon/dp/B01GHUA3XA) wich was great, when I forgot it at home when I wanted to do a AMA during traveling I bought a [Rode NT-USB](https://www.thomann.de/de/rode_nt_usb.htm) and I love it. I keeped the mounting arm of the maranz and mounted it on my monitorarm, so it is decoupled from my desk and from all the vibrations I produce while typing.
While traveling, I use the Rode with the small tripod the ship mic.

## Streaming software

My first motivation was to start doing AMA sessions and Tutorials on Twitch or YouTube. So I started with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/de) wich works awesome. For my first workshops I used [Google Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/) which worked fine. But there are some features missing, like muting/unmuting attendees, so I choose [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). So nothing very special.

Im always looking for optimization so my setup might change over the time.
